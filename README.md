# Study for Design of Noise and Process Variation Tolerant, Low-Power, High-Speed, and Low-Energy Full Adders in CNFET Technology

## VLSI Analog Design, Layout Design, Reaserch Paper Study

Findings: In this paper, a number of novel 1-bit full adder cells using carbon nanotube field-effect
transistor devices are presented.
First of all, some two-input XOR/XNOR circuits are proposed, and then, they are
employed to form 1-bit full adders.
Totally, five full adders with driving power and one without driving power are proposed
in this paper, each of which has its own merits.
In this project main focus is on reducing the power consumption of the circuit and
increasing its performance.
Different full adder circuits are being compared based on their power delay and energy
delay products.
Simulations with regard to supply power scaling and different load conditions confirm
the superiority of the proposed cells compared with the previously reported ones in
terms of power, delay, power-delay product (PDP), and Energy delay product (EDP).
Also embedding the proposed full adders in the large circuits, such as ripple carry adder
(RCA), with a wide word length shows that they have better power, speed, and PDP
with regard to their counterparts.
Furthermore, the susceptibility of the full adders against both input noise and process
variations (diameter deviations of carbon nanotubes) is studied.
